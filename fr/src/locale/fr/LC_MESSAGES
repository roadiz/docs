msgid "Roadiz standard edition is shipped with a ``docker-compose`` example environment ready to use for development. *Docker* on Linux will provide awesome performances and a production-like environment without bloating your development machine. Performances won't be as good on *macOS* or *Windows* hosts, but it will prevent installing singled versioned PHP and MySQL directly on your computer."

msgid "First, edit ``.env`` file and configure it according to your host machine (you can copy it from ``.env.dist`` if it does not exist)."
