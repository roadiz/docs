msgid "*Composer* will prompt you if you want to can versioning history. Choose the default answer ``no`` as we definitely want to replace *standard-edition* *Git* with our own versioning. Then you will be able to customize every files in your projects and save them using Git, not only your theme. Of course we added a default ``.gitignore`` file to prevent your configuration setting and entry points to be commited in your *Git* history. That way you can have different configuration on development and on your production server without bothering about merge conflicts."

msgid "For *Windows* users, ``bin/roadiz themes:generate --symlink --relative FooBar`` command can be used without ``--relative`` option to create **absolute symlinks**. You can even install your theme assets as *hard copies* without ``--symlink`` option. Make sure that you call regularly ``bin/roadiz themes:assets:install FooBar`` when using *hard copy* mode to update your assets. You should use *symlinks* if possible to prevent update issues."

At this moment, if you try to connect to your fresh new Roadiz website, you will get an error as we did not install its database and its essential data."

You’ll find a ``dev.php`` file at your website root which was generated at ``composer install`` command. As well as *install.php* entry point, you’ll need to add your own IP address to filter who can access to your *dev* environment."

msgid "The *clear_cache* environment is only meant to empty Roadiz cache without waking up the whole application. It can be useful if you are using a op-code cache like *APC* or native PHP *OPcache*. These special caches can’t be purged from command line utilities, so you need to call a PHP script from your browser or via ``curl`` to empty them. Like *install* and *dev* environment, ``clear_cache.php`` is IP-restricted not to allow everyone to flush your dear caches. You’ll need to add your own IP address to filter who can access it."
