msgid "Nodes are essentially hierarchical entities. So we created an entity to link nodes between them no matter where/what they are. Tags are meant as *tag* nodes, we couldn’t be more explicit. But if you didn’t understand here is a schema:"

#: ../../src/developer/tags-system/index.rst:14
msgid "You can see that tags can gather heterogenous nodes coming from different types (pages and projects). Tags can be used to display a category-navigation on your theme or to simply tidy your backoffice node database."

#: ../../src/developer/tags-system/index.rst:17
msgid "Did you notice that ``Tags`` are related to ``Nodes`` entities, not ``NodesSources``? We thought that it would be easier to manage that way not to forget to tag a specific node translation. It means that you won’t be able to differenciate tag two ``NodesSources``, if you absolutely need to, we encourage you to create two different nodes."

msgid "You will notice that tags work the same way as nodes do. By default, *tags names* can’t contain special characters in order to be used in URLs. So we created ``TagTranslation`` entities which stand for Tag’s sources:"
