msgid "You have to run unit-tests on a dedicated database not to lose any existing Roadiz website. You can create a ``conf/config_test.yml`` YAML configuration which will be read only for this environment. Then, wire this configuration to a blank database. Unit-tests can be launched by the following command:"

msgid "If your are writing a feature, don't forget to write a unit test for it. You can find some example in the folder ``tests``. In Roadiz, there are 4 types of tests:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/contributing.rst:39
msgid "Standard tests which must extend ``\\PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase``. These tests should only test simple logic methods and classes as they won’t require Roadiz kernel to boot up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/contributing.rst:40
msgid "Kernel dependent tests which must extend `RZ\\Roadiz\\Tests\\KernelDependentCase``. These tests should only test logic classes and methods inside Roadiz kernel without any database concern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/contributing.rst:41
msgid "Schema dependent tests which must extend ``RZ\\Roadiz\\Tests\\SchemaDependentCase``. These tests should only test low level database methods and classes without relying on node-types or translations. Use this type of testing if you want to test Roadiz entities and repositories methods except for Nodes and NodeTypes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/contributing.rst:42
msgid "DefaultTheme dependent tests which must extend ``RZ\\Roadiz\\Tests\\DefaultThemeDependentCase``. These tests rely on a complete Roadiz installation with existing node-types and translation. They are longer to prepare as PHPUnit must install a fresh Roadiz with DefaultTheme at each case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/contributing.rst:45
msgid "Each ``SchemaDependentCase`` and ``DefaultThemeDependentCase`` will provision a fresh Roadiz database then drop it. Make sure to use a dedicated database. If you execute unit-tests from an existing Roadiz website, you’ll have to run ``bin/roadiz generate:nsentities`` at the end of your testing session to build your NodesSources classes again (every environment share the same ``gen-src`` folder)."

Just execute ``make test`` and ``phpcbf`` and ``phpstan`` will test your theme sources. If you are using *Gitlab CI/CD* with our ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` file, those tests will be executed at each pipeline trigger."
