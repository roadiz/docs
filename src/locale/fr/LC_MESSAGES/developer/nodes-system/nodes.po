msgid "Handling nodes and their hierarchy"

msgid ""
"By default, if you use Entities API methods or trasversing Twig filters, "
"Roadiz will automatically handle security parameters such as "
"``node.status`` and ``preview`` mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:22
msgid ""
"This first code snippet is using *Node-source API*. This will "
"automatically check if current user is logged-in and if preview mode is "
"*ON* to display or not *unpublished nodes*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:34
msgid ""
"This second code snippet uses standard Doctrine *Entity Manager* to "
"directly grab node-sources by their entity class. This method does not "
"check any security and will return every node-sources, **even "
"unpublished, archived and deleted ones**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:39
msgid "Hierarchy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:41
msgid ""
"To trasverse node-sources hierarchy, the easier method is to use *Twig* "
"filters on your ``nodeSource`` entity. Filters will implicitly set "
"``translation`` from origin node-source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:58
msgid ""
"All these filters will take care of publication status and translation, "
"**but not publication date-time neither visibility**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:73
msgid ""
"If you need to traverse node-source graph from your controllers you can "
"use the *Entity API*. Moreover, Nodes-sources API allows you to filter "
"using custom criteria if you choose a specific ``NodeType``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:89
msgid ""
"Browsing your node graph (calling children or parents) could be very "
"greedy and unoptimized if you have lots of node-types. Internally "
"*Doctrine* will *inner-join* every nodes-sources tables to perform "
"polymorphic hydratation. So, make sure you filter your queries by one "
"``NodeType`` as much as possible with ``nodeSourceApi`` and "
"``node.nodeType`` criteria."

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:107
msgid ""
"There are two parametres that you must take care of in your themes and "
"your controllers, because they are not mandatory in all website cases:"

msgid "Publication date and time"
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:113
msgid ""
"For example, *publication date and time* won’t be necessary in plain text"
" pages and not timestampable contents. But we decided to add it directly "
"in ``NodesSources`` entity to be able to filter and order with this field"
" in Roadiz back-office. This was not possible if you manually create your"
" own ``publishedAt`` as a node-type field."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:120
msgid ""
"Pay attention that *publication date and time* (``publishedAt``) and "
"visibility (``node.visible``) **does not prevent** your node-source from "
"being viewed if you did not explicitly forbid access to its controller. "
"This field is not deeply set into Roadiz security mechanics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/nodes-system/nodes.rst:125
msgid ""
"If you need so, make sure that your node-type controller checks these two"
" fields and throws a ``ResourceNotFoundException`` if they’re not "
"satisfied."

msgid ""
"You can override default node-source path generation in order to use ``{{"
" path() }}`` method in your *Twig* templates but with a custom logic. For"
" example, you have a ``Link`` node-type which purpose only is to link to "
"an other node in your website. When you call *path* or *URL* generation "
"on it, you should prefer getting its linked node path, so you can listen "
"to "
"``RZ\\Roadiz\\Core\\Events\\NodesSources\\NodesSourcesPathGeneratingEvent:class``"

"your *link* node path."
