"A node-type is the blueprint for your node-source. It will contain all "
"fields that Roadiz will use to generate an extended node-source class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, a node-type \"Page\" will contain \"content\" and \"header "
"image\" fields. The \"title\" field is always available as it is hard-"
"coded in ``NodesSources`` class. After saving your node-type, Roadiz "
"generates a ``NSPage`` class which extends the ``NodesSources`` class. "
"You will find it in the ``gen-src/GeneratedNodeSources`` (or ``app/gen-"
"src/GeneratedNodeSources`` with *Roadiz Standard edition*). Then Roadiz "
"calls *Doctrine* update tool to migrate your database schema. **Do not "
"modify the generated class.** You’ll have to update it by the backend "
"interface."

"Most of node-types management will be done in your backoffice interface. "
"You will be able to create, update node-types objects and each of their "
"node-type fields independently. But if you prefer, you can use CLI "
"commands to create types and fields. With Roadiz CLI commands you get "
"several tools to manage node-types. We really encourage you to check the "
"commands with ``--help`` argument, as following:"

#: ../../developer/nodes-system/intro.rst:52
msgid ""
"Keep in mind that each node-type or node-type fields operation require a "
"database update as Doctrine have to create a specific table per node-"
"type. Do not forget to execute ``bin/roadiz orm:schema-tool:update`` "
"tools to perform updates. It’s very important to understand that "
"*Doctrine* needs to see your node-types generated classes **before** "
"upgrading database schema. If they don’t exist, it won’t able to create "
"your custom types tables, or worst, it could delete existing data since "
"*Doctrine* won’t recognize specific tables."

"Once your node-type created, its definition is stored in database in "

msgid ""
"With Roadiz, each node-types data (called node-sources) is stored in a "
"different table prefixed with ``ns_``. When you create a *Page* node-type"
" with 2 fields (*content* and *excerpt*), Roadiz tells Doctrine to build "
"a ``ns_page`` table with 2 columns and one primary key column inherited "
"from ``nodes_sources`` table. It’s called *inheritance mapping*: your "
"``ns_page`` table extends ``nodes_sources`` table and when you are "
"querying a *Page* from database, Doctrine mix the data coming from these "
"2 tables to create a complete node-source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/nodes-system/intro.rst:75
msgid ""
"At the end your node-source *Page* won’t contain only 2 fields but many "
"more as ``NodesSources`` entity offers ``title``, ``metaTitle``, "
"``metaDescription``, ``metaKeywords`` and others useful data-fields which"
" can be used among all node-types."

msgid ""
"Node-sources inheritance mapping is not only used to customize data but "
"to make data translations available. As you saw in the first picture, "
"each nodes can handle many node-sources, one per translation."
