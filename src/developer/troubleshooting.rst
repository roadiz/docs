Troubleshooting
===============

Empty caches manually for an environment
----------------------------------------

If you experience errors only on a dedicated environment such as
``prod``or ``dev``, it means that cache is not fresh for
these environments. As a first try, you should always call
``bin/console cache:clear;`` (replace *prod* by your environment)
in command line.

.. code-block:: shell

    bin/console cache:clear --env=prod;
    bin/console cache:pool:clear cache.global_clearer --env=prod;

Problem with entities and Doctrine cache?
-----------------------------------------

After each Roadiz **upgrade** you should always upgrade your
node-sources entity classes and upgrade database schema.

.. code-block:: shell

    bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate -n;
    bin/console app:install -n;
    bin/console cache:clear;
    bin/console cache:pool:clear cache.global_clearer;
