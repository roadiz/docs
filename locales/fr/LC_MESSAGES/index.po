"Roadiz is a polymorphic CMS based on a node system that can handle many "
"types of services. It is based on *Symfony* components, *Doctrine ORM*, "
"*Twig* and *Pimple* for maximum performances and security."

"Roadiz node system allows you to create your data schema and to organize "
"your content as you want. We designed it to break technical constraints "
"when you create tailor-made websites architectures and layouts."

"Imagine you need to display your graphic design portfolio and… sell some "
"t-shirts. With Roadiz you will be able to create your content forms from "
"scratch and choose the right fields you need. Images and texts for your "
"projects. Images, texts, prices and even geolocation for your products. "
"That’s why it’s called *polymorphic*."

"When discovering Roadiz back-office interface, you will notice that there"
" aren’t any Rich text editor also called *WYSIWYG* editors. We chose to "
"promote *Markdown* syntax in order to focus on content hierarchy and "
"quality instead of content style. Our guideline is to preserve and "
"respect the webdesigners' and graphic designers' work."

"You’ll see that we built Roadiz as webdesigners and for webdesigners. It "
"will allow you to create really quickly website prototypes using *Twig* "
"templates. But as the same time you will be able to get the power of the "
"*Symfony* and *Doctrine* core components to build complex applications."

"We also decided to be really strict about Plugins and other addons "
"modules. How many of you do not upgrade your Wordpress website because of"
" plugin dependencies? We decided not to build Roadiz around a “Plugin” "
"system but a **Theme system**, as every Roadiz extensions will have to "
"serve a theme’s features. Themes will enable you to create awesome "
"website layouts but also great back-office additions for your customers. "
"You will be able to centralize all your custom code in one place, so you "
"can use a versioning tool such as Git."

msgid ""
"Roadiz theme system will allow you to daisy-chain themes and dispatch "
"features on multiple code. As our CMS is built on Pimple dependency "
"injection container, Roadiz can merge every available themes on the same "
"website. For example, you will be able to create one portfolio theme "
"using Node-system Urls and unlimited static themes which will use a "
"static routing scheme, for a Forum or a Blog or even both! Theme system "
"will even allow you to create additional Doctrine entities and extend our"
" back-office. Yes, just sit on your theme code and you can extend Roadiz "
"to create a manager for your Forum. Cherry on the cake, you can assign "
"each theme to a specific domain name to create mobile or media specific "
"layouts. Believe me, this cake is not a lie."

"We want Roadiz to be a great tool for designers and developers to build "
"strong web experiences together. But we thought of editors too! Roadiz "
"back-office theme “Rozier” has been designed to offer every back-users a "
"great writing and administrating experience."
