"Roadiz themes are one of the main parts of the CMS. They allow you to "
"create your really personal website. You can duplicate an existing theme "
"to customize stylesheets and images. Or you can start from ground and "
"build your very own theme using our API. Every visible part of Roadiz is "
"a theme. Even backoffice interface is a theme, and it’s called *Rozier* "
"according to the street name where REZO ZERO created it."

"As these 3 themes come bundled with Roadiz, you can’t edit or update "
"their files. Your changes would be overrode the next time you update "
"Roadiz via Git or direct download. If you want to create your own "
"Backoffice, you can. Just name it differently and hook it in backoffice "
"or using CLI commands."

"If you are using Roadiz *Source edition*, we configured *Git* versioning "
"tool to ignore every additional theme you create in ``/themes`` folder. "
"So you can **initialize your a new git repository per custom theme you "
"create.** That way you can use code versioning independently from Roadiz "
"updates."

"Before searching for a node’s Url (Dynamic routing), Roadiz will parse "
"your theme ``route.yml`` to find static controllers and actions to "

"An indexAction method must comply with the following signature. It will "

"As *Symfony* controllers do, every Roadiz controllers actions have to "

"template and an assignation array."

"It’s very easy to create *JSON* responses for your API with Roadiz. You "
