"For a simple website theme, base assignation will work for almost every "

" will be able to render all your page fields."

"Now imagine you need to load data from another node than the one being "
"requested. Or imagine that you want to create a complex homepage which "
"displays a summary of your latest news. You will need to extend existing "
"assignated variables."

msgid ""
"For example, create a simple node-type called *Page*. Add several basic "
"fields inside it such as *content* and *images*. If you well-understood "
":ref:`how to create a theme <create-theme>` section you will create a "

"Custom assignations are great but what can I do if I have to use the same"
" variables in several controllers? We added a special "
"``extendAssignation`` method which is called at the end of your theme "
"preparation process (``prepareThemeAssignation`` and "
"``prepareNodeSourceAssignation``). Just override it in your "
"``MyThemeApp`` main class, then every theme controllers and templates "
"will be able to use these variables."

msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/themes/custom_assignations.rst:110
msgid ""
"At REZO ZERO, we often use complex page design which need removable and "
"movable parts. At first we used to create long node-types with a lot of "
"fields, and when editors needed to move content to an other position, "
"they had to cut and paste text to another field. It was long and not very"
" sexy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/themes/custom_assignations.rst:115
msgid ""
"So we thought about a modulable way to build pages. We decided to use one"
" master node-type and several slave node-types instead of a single big "
"type. Here is what we call **Page/Block pattern**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/themes/custom_assignations.rst:118
msgid ""
"This pattern takes advantage of Roadiz node hierarchy. We create a very "
"light *Page* node-type, with an *excerpt* and a *thumbnail* fields, then "
"we create an other node-type that we will call *BasicBlock*. This block "
"node-type will have a *content* and *image* fields."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/themes/custom_assignations.rst:122
msgid ""
"The magic comes when we add a last field into *Page* master node-type "
"called *children_nodes*. This special field will display a node-tree "
"inside your edit page. In this field parameter, we add *BasicBlock* name "
"as a default value to tell Roadiz that each *Page* nodes will be able to "
"contain *BasicBlock* nodes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/themes/custom_assignations.rst:126
msgid ""
"So you understood that all your page data will be allocated in several "
"*BasicBlock* nodes. Then your editor will just have to change block order"
" to re-arrange your page content. That’s not all! With this pattern you "
"can join images to each block so that each paragraph can be pictured with"
" a *Document* field. No need to insert image tags right into your "
"Markdown text as you would do in a Wordpress article."

"Now that you’ve structured your data with a *Page* node-type and a "
"*BasicBlock*, how do render your data in only one page and only one URL "
"request? We will use custom assignations!"

msgid ""
"You can directly assign your children blocks at the beginning of your "
"*Twig* template. Make sure the global ``bags`` service is available and "
"reachable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/themes/custom_assignations.rst:147
msgid ""
"You can use different *block* types in the same *page*. Just create as "
"many node-types as you need and add their name to your *Page* "
"``children_node`` default values. Then add each node-type into "
"``children`` criteria using an array instead of a single value: "
"``node.nodeType : [bags.nodeTypes.get('BasicBlock'), "
"bags.nodeTypes.get('AnotherBlock')]``. That way, you will be able to "
"create awesome pages with different looks but with the same template "
"(basic blocks, gallery blocks, etc)."

msgid ""
"*Whaaat? What is that include?* This trick will save you a lot of time! "
"We ask Twig to include a sub-template according to each block type name. "
"Eg. for a *BasicBlock* node, Twig will include a "
"``blocks/basicblock.html.twig`` file. It’s even more powerful when you "
"are using multiple block types because Twig will automatically choose the"
" right template to render each part of your page."

"A few times, using *Page / Block* pattern won’t be enough to display your"

msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/themes/custom_assignations.rst:217

"For this we added a ``render`` filter which basically create a sub-"
