msgid ""
"*Roadiz’* main feature is all about its polymorphic document model which "
"is mapped on a relational database. This requires a challenging structure"
" which can be lead to some performance bottlenecks when dealing with more"
" than 20-30 node-types. So we made the data inheritance model "
"configurable to allow switching to `single_table <https://www.doctrine-"
"project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.7/reference/inheritance-"
"mapping.html#single-table-inheritance>`_ scheme which will be more "
"performant if you need lots of node-types. However *Single class* model "
"will drop support for indexable fields and you won’t be able to create "
"fields with the *same name but not the same type* because all node-type "
"fields will be created in the **same SQL table**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../src/developer/first-steps/manual_config.rst:47
msgid ""
"If you really need to create indexable fields and to mix field types, we "
"advise you to keep the original `joined table <https://www.doctrine-"
"project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.7/reference/inheritance-"
"mapping.html#class-table-inheritance>`_ inheritance type which creates a "
"dedicated SQL table for each node-type. *Joined table* inheritance can be"
" very useful with a small number of node-type (max. 20) and very "
"different fields. But its main drawback is that Roadiz needs to *LEFT "
"JOIN* every node-type table for each node-source query, **unless you "
"specify one node-type criteria**."
